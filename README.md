An analog clock features a round dial and two moving hands (one for hours and one for minutes) that display the current time by aligning with numerical markers or symbols on its face. It provides a visual way to assess the current hour and minute, simplifying time reading.


# Introduction:
This code snippet presents a simple yet visually appealing analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock is designed as a circular element with hour, minute, and second hands. It also includes hour markers from 1 to 12.

 # HTML Structure:
The code starts with the HTML structure contained within a <div> element with the class "container." Inside this container, there is a clock represented by another <div> element with the class "clock." The clock includes hour, minute, and second hands, each styled with different colors and lengths using custom CSS variables.

# Clock Hands:

The "hour" hand is red (#ff3d58) .
The "minute" hand is blue (#00a6ff) .
The "second" hand is white (#ffffff) .
 # Hour Markers:
The clock features twelve hour markers, from 1 to 12, represented by <span> elements styled using custom CSS variables.

# Script:
The clock functionality is powered by an external JavaScript file ("clock.js") linked at the end of the HTML file. This JavaScript file likely contains code to manipulate the rotation angles of the clock hands to reflect the current time.

# Conclusion:
This code demonstrates a visually appealing analog clock created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a creative and engaging way to display the current time on a web page. Developers can further customize and enhance this clock to fit the design and functionality requirements of their projects.
